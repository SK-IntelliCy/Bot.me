# LiDAR Integration and Robot Simulation in ROS

This project demonstrates the integration of a LiDAR sensor with a robot in **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and visualization using **RViz** and **Gazebo**.  
The robot model was created with URDF/Xacro, equipped with a LiDAR sensor, and controlled using the **TurtleBot package** for navigation and movement.
